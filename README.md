# Neural_GSUN_Process
Neural-based inference for the generalized unified skew-normal (GSUN) process

1. The R scripts gen_block, gen_sample, gen_test, and sample involve generations of the realizations of the GSUN process
2. The minimax_tilting_sampler is a python implementation of efficient sampling from the truncated multivariate normal distribution
3. The proc_gen file is a python implementation for the GSUN process generation
4. The GAT_layer file is for the graphical attention network
5. The trans_neural_bayes file involves all kinds of neural Bayes estimators tested and studied in the paper
6. The train_test file is used to get the estimations for the two specified set of parameters in the paper.
